# ArqSandBox

## Description 
This is a sandbox for software architecture and design patterns.

## Domain
Domains will be chosen for each implementation. The domains will be chosen based on the complexity of the domain and the need for different architectural styles.

As documented on [decision record #2](docs/architecture-decision-records/0002-domain-storytelling.md), Domain Storytelling will be used to describe the features implemented before any design decisions.

Domain Story diagrams are created using LucidChart.

[All diagrams can be viewed here](https://lucid.app/folder/invitations/accept/inv_814df013-936a-41ab-b044-4916b8eacd8c).

## Architectural Styles
In this repository, different architectural styles will be implemented:
 - EBI (Entity-Boundary-Interactor);
 - Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal Architecture);
 - Onion Architecture;
 - Clean Architecture;
 - DDD (Domain Driven Design);
