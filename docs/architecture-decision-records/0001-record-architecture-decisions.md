# 1.  Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-03-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the project is a sandbox with many architectural decisions, it is necessary to save all of them in one place.

## Decision

For all architectural decisions, Architecture Decision Records (ADR), a log file will be created.

Each ADR will be recorded using [Michael Nygard template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), which contains following sections: Status, Context, Decision and Consequences.

## Consequences

All architectural decisions should be recorded. Old decisions should be recorded as well with an approximate decision date. New decisions should be recorded on a regular basis.
