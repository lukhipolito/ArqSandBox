# 2.  Domain Storytelling

Date: 2025-03-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Before writing any software there must be a clear way to communicate the requirements. Domain Storytelling is a technique that helps to understand the domain and the requirements of the software. 

It is a collaborative technique that involves all stakeholders in the process of creating a shared understanding of the domain.

## Decision

Before any implementation there must be clear Domain Stories for the features being implemented.

The domain stories will follow the structure of the [offical Domain Storytelling pictographic language](https://domainstorytelling.org/quick-start-guide#the-pictographic-language).





## Consequences

Design and architecture will be forced to be more aligned with the business requirements.

All implementation will actually solve a problem.
